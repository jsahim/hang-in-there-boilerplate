# Hang in There  

### Abstract:

- We added added functionality to motivational poster site that allowed the user to generate random poster configuration, save their favorite posters, view their saved posters and create their own posters with unique titles, quotes and images. The app provides instant access to motivational materials that get you thorough the day. It does so by allowing you to save posters that resonate with you as well as create personalized posters that you can refer back when feeling down.
